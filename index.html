    <h2>Thoughts on Web Assessibility</h2>
    </ul>
    <article>My thoughts on Web Assessibility are that you should always have a way for every person to be able to 
      ascess your web site. Like the lang="en" is for the voice recorder so it knows the language of the site and when you
      format the html right it can be easier for the program to put it on the web and so it can understand to site. I like to 
      make sure that I use the proper way of the html commands.

    <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancements</h2>
    <article>
      The progressive enhancements is good because you can get all the bugs or coding look right.
      In my project I put the necessities in the code to make it work and look right then I added the features
      that made my code work better, look different and act different.

      They said that it was good but there were no pictures and the contact did not have anything and the coloring was off.
